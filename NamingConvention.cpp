	/*Naming Convention (Rules tO name Variable , Function , arrays , list ,Class any user Define Object )
	Rules:
	1 Variable names must begin with an alphabet.
	2 The first character may be followed by a sequence of letters or digits and can also include a
	  special character like the ‘underscore‘.
	3 Avoid using the letter O in places where it can be confused with the number 0 and similarly the
   	  lowercase letter L can be mistaken for the number 1.
	4 Proper names should be  while naming variables.
	5 Typically, uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as different i.e. variables ADD, add and Add
	  are all different.
	6 As case-sensitivity considerations vary with programming languages it is advisable to maintain a
	  standard way of naming variables.
	7 A variable name should be meaningful and descriptive; it should describe the kind of data it holds.
	val1
	var1
	8 For example, if the sum of two numbers is to be found, the variable storing the result may be
	  called sum. Naming it s or ab12 is not a good idea.
	9 space is not allowed in identifiers
	  
	  **The names of variables, functions, labels, and various other user-defined objects are called identifiers
